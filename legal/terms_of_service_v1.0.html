    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2025-02-05</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to OMGSERVERS. By using our services, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any
        part
        of these terms, you should not use OMGSERVERS.</p>
    <p>OMGSERVERS provides backend solutions for authoritative game servers. These terms outline your rights and
        responsibilities when using our service.</p>

    <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Service"</strong> refers to OMGSERVERS and its provided functionalities.</li>
        <li><strong>"Developer"</strong> refers to a user who directly uses and pays for the service.</li>
        <li><strong>"Account"</strong> refers to a registered developer profile.</li>
        <li><strong>"Docker Image"</strong> refers to any containerized software uploaded by developers.</li>
        <li><strong>"Player"</strong> refers to an individual who plays a game running on OMGSERVERS infrastructure but
            does
            not interact with OMGSERVERS directly.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>There are no age restrictions for using OMGSERVERS. However, developers must provide accurate registration
        details
        and cannot transfer their accounts to third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Account Registration and Security</h2>
    <p>Developers must provide accurate information during registration. OMGSERVERS is not responsible for unauthorized
        access due to weak password security by developers. Account sharing or transfer is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <h2>5. Use of the Service</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Developers may upload and manage their own Docker images.</li>
        <li>OMGSERVERS does not claim ownership of developer-uploaded Docker images; they are used solely for providing
            the
            service.
        </li>
        <li>Developers must not upload Docker images containing illegal, malicious, or rights-infringing content.</li>
        <li>OMGSERVERS provides infrastructure for games but is not responsible for player behavior or content within
            hosted
            games.
        </li>
        <li>Players do not interact directly with OMGSERVERS and are subject to the terms set by the respective game
            developers. OMGSERVERS does not provide player support or enforce policies for individual game experiences.
        </li>
        <li>OMGSERVERS does not collect or store personal data of players. Any player-related data managed by games
            running
            on OMGSERVERS infrastructure is the responsibility of the respective game developers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Restrictions</h2>
    <p>Developers must not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deploy software that infringes copyrights or violates legal regulations.</li>
        <li>Engage in any activity that could harm the platform or other developers.</li>
        <li>Host or distribute content that violates applicable laws or encourages harmful activities within their
            games.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Violations may result in temporary or permanent account suspension.</p>

    <h2>7. Payments and Refunds</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Developers must pay for service usage on a monthly basis.</li>
        <li>There is no subscription auto-renewal; developers must manually process payments.</li>
        <li>Refunds are not provided under any circumstances.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Service Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>OMGSERVERS is currently in Beta and therefore does not provide any guarantees of uptime or data integrity.
        Compensation for service disruptions is not available during this phase.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination of Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Developers may request account deletion by contacting support.</li>
        <li>OMGSERVERS reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts in case of rule violations without prior
            warning.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>OMGSERVERS is provided "as is" with no guarantees of uninterrupted service. Developers assume all risks
        associated
        with using the service.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>OMGSERVERS is not liable for data loss, service disruptions, or any damages resulting from the use of the
        service.</p>

    <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>Developers agree to indemnify OMGSERVERS against any claims resulting from their violation of these terms.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>Since OMGSERVERS is not registered as a legal entity, developers acknowledge that legal matters related to the
        service will be handled according to general internet jurisdiction standards.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>OMGSERVERS may update these terms at any time. Developers are responsible for reviewing changes, as notifications
        will not be sent.</p>
