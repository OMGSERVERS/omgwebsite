    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2025-02-05</strong></p>

    <h2>1. General Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>OMGSERVERS operates on a <strong>strict no-refund policy</strong>. Payments made for the use of our services are
        <strong>final and non-refundable</strong> under any circumstances, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Service interruptions or downtime.</li>
        <li>Developer dissatisfaction with features or performance.</li>
        <li>Unintentional payments or mistaken purchases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Exceptional Cases</h2>
    <p>Refunds may only be considered in rare and exceptional cases, at the sole discretion of OMGSERVERS, under the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A double charge or billing error caused directly by OMGSERVERS.</li>
        <li>The developer was <strong>unable to access</strong> the service due to a verified and unresolved technical issue caused by OMGSERVERS.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To request a refund under these conditions, you must submit a written request within <strong>7 days of the payment date</strong> by contacting our support team.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription and Payment Responsibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>OMGSERVERS does <strong>not</strong> offer automatic subscription renewals. Developers must manually process payments for continued service.</li>
        <li>Failure to cancel an account or stop service usage before the next billing cycle does <strong>not</strong> qualify for a refund.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
    <p>Initiating a chargeback or payment dispute through your payment provider may result in the <strong>immediate suspension or termination</strong> of your OMGSERVERS account. If you believe a billing issue has occurred, please contact our support team first to resolve the matter.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>OMGSERVERS reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Developers are responsible for reviewing updates, as notifications will not be sent.</p>

    <p>For any questions regarding refunds, please contact our support team.</p>
